# 0.2.9-dev

- Add experimental support for `textDocument/codeActions` and
  `workspace/applyEdit`

# 0.2.7

  called `g:lsc_enable_incremental_sync` which is defaulted to `v:false` to
  allow the client to attempt incremental syncs. This feature is experimental.
- Bug Fix: Use buffer filetype rather than current filetype when flushing file
  changes for background buffers.
- Update the diagnostic under the cursor when diagnostics change for the file.
- Bug Fix: Don't change diagnostic highlights while in visual mode.

# 0.2.6

  windows other than the current window.

  of the language server for the current filetype.
- `:LSCRestartServer` can now restart servers that failed, rather than just
  those which are currently running.
- Bug Fix: Always send `didOpen` calls with the content they have at the time of
  initialization rather than what they had when the buffer was read. Fixes some
  cases where an edit before the server is read would get lost.

  null.
- Bug Fix: Handle case where initialization call gets a null response.
- Bug Fix: Avoid breaking further callbacks when a message handler throws.

- `LSClientShowHover` now reuses the window it already opened rather than
  closing it and splitting again to allow for maintaining layout.
- Add optional configuration `g:lsc_preview_split_direction` to override
  `splitbelow`.
