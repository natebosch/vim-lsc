# 0.5.0

**Bug fixes**
- Fix occasional errors stemming from interleaving the handling of multiple
  messages from the server.
- Support the `DocumentHighlightOptions` format for
  `documentHighlightsProvider`.
- Avoid a state where no document highlights reference calls are made following
  a server restart.
- Avoid creating public functions for callbacks which should be temporary.

**Minor breaking changes**
- Remove `noselect` from the default `completeopts` used during autocompletion.
  Re-enable this with `set completeopts+=noselect`. This changes the initial
  behavior of some keys when autocomplete starts.

**Enhancements**
- Improve performance when the language server sends many diagnostics updates.
- Improve performance for periods of high message throughput.

# 0.4.0

**Bug fixes**
- Allow use with version that don't have the `trim()` function.
- Avoid sending unnecessary `didClose` notifications for buffers of the wrong
  filetype.
- Fix `getbufinfo` calls for loaded buffers.
- Fix completions starting at the beginning of the line when the server did not
  send any items containing a `textEdit` field.
- Truncate diagnostics at 1 character shorter for when `ruler` is used.
- Normalize windows file path separators to create valid URIs.
- Don't send `textDocument/didSave` notifications if the server does not
  advertise it as a capability.
- Fix edits when there are folds in the buffer.

**Minor breaking changes**
- Server dictionaries no longer expose their full `init_results`, or their call
  logs.
- Default keybinding for `LSClientSignatureHelp` changed to `gm`.
- Notifications which are not handled by the client are ignored instead of
  reported.

**Enhancements**
- More tolerant towards buggy language servers that omit the `result` field on
  response message.
- Add `g:lsc_autocomplete_length` to configure how many word characters to wait
  for before starting autocomplete. Set to `0` or `v:false` to disable
  autocomplete on anything other than trigger characters, or to a number to vary
  the length before autocomplete from the default of `3`.
- Add support for skipping calls by adding a `message_hook` and returning
  `lsc#config#skip()`.
- Add `'notifications'` support in server config to add callbacks for server
  specific notifications.
- After calling `:LSClientAllDiagnostics` the quickfix list will be kept up to
  date with all diagnostics across the project, until it is set by some other
  tool.
- Add support for a `workspace_config` server configuration key which causes a
  `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification on server startup.
- Use the popup window for hover.
- Add autocmd `User LSCDiagnosticsChange` to trigger when diagnostics are
  received.
- Add support for a custom action menu with `g:LSC_action_menu`.
- Sort completion suggestions that match by prefix higher than those that match
  by substring.
- Include Completion item `detail` field in the preview window.
- Strikethrough deprecated completion options in the menu.
- Improve performance of finding incremental changes for file syncing in very
  large files when lua support is available.
- Send `hover.contentFormat` to prefer plaintext content which should be more
  readable for most users.
- Use full words for completion item kinds instead of single letters.
- Avoid overwriting location list if it is in use for something other than LSC
  diagnostics.
- Asynchronously loop over server messages to avoid long synchronous pauses
  between handling user input.

# 0.3.2

- `:LSClientShowHover` is now bound with `keywordprg` instead of by mapping `K`.
  If the `g:lsc_auto_map` manually specifies a binding of `'K'` it should be
  dropped to pick up the default, or switched to `v:true` to use `keywordprg`
  instead. If the mapping is set to a string it will continue to be mapped as
  usual, if it is mapped to `0` or `v:false` no mapping will occur, if it is set
  to `1` or `v:true` then `keywordprg` will be set. `:LSClientShowHover` also
  now allows an argument but it will always be ignored.
- Added `g:lsc_enable_dagnostics`. Set to `v:false` to ignore all diagnostics
  sent by the server.
- Notifications with a method starting with `$/` will be silently dropped
  instead of showing a message.
- Fix a bug where `au_group_id` was not initialized correctly.
- Ignore a `null` or empty `insertText` during completion.

- Add support for `:LSClientSignatureHelp` which calls
  `textDocument/signatureHelp`.
- Add highlighting group `lscCurrentParameter` which is used to highlight the
  active parameter in the signature help.
- Send `textDocument/didSave` notifications on `BufWritePost` if the server does
  not indicate they should be skipped.
- Call `initialized` in response to the `initialize` result.
- Fix a bug with responding to `window/showMessage` notifications.
- Wait to call 'exit' until the 'shutdown' response comes back.
- Update tag stack when jumping to definition.
- Add special handling for window/progress messages
- Add `:LSClientLineDiagnostics` to print diagnostics for the current line.
- Allow server commands to be specified as lists.
- Allow filtering what level of logs are echoed.
- Fix a bug with incremental text change syncing when there are multi-byte
  characters in the buffer.
- Fix some bugs with editing in a buffer for a file which has not been written,
  and would be written to a directory that does not exist.
- Add `:LSClientGoToDefinitionSplit` to go to definitions in a split window
  (depending on `switchbuf`).
- Fix a bug where some uses of the quick fix list would modify paths under the
  home directory and make it impossible to jump to them.
- Fix a race condition where the same message from the server may be handled
  twice.

# 0.3.1

- Don't eagerly attempt to fetch completions when autocomplete is disabled.
