*lsc*  Language Server Client

INTRODUCTION                                    *lsc-intro*

vim-lsc communicates with a server following the Language Server Protocol and
adds autocomplete, diagnostic highlighting, and reference searching.

vim-lsc does not have any built-in support for any language, all features are
enabled through language specific servers and should work with any server
following the protocol. Each feature is dependent on support in the configured
server.

https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc

SETUP                                           *lsc-setup*
                                                *g:lsc_server_commands*

There is no install step for vim-lsc. Configure the filetypes that are tracked
by installed language servers in the variable "g:lsc_server_commands". Each
value in this dict should be a string which corresponds to either an
executable in your "$PATH", an absolute path to an executable, or a
"host:port" pair. If multiple filetypes are tracked by the same server they
should be entered as separate keys with the same value. The value may also be
a `dict` to allow for additional configuration. See |lsc-server-customization|
for allowed keys. `'command'` is required and matches the command above when a
dict is not used.

For example:

>
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
     \ 'dart': 'dart_language_server',
     \ 'html': 'dart_language_server',
     \ 'typescript': 'localhost:8000',
     \ 'lua': {
     \   'name': 'lua',
     \   'command': 'lua-ls',
     \   'enabled': v:false,
     \ },
     \}
<

lsc will communicate with each server following the LSP protocol. If the
command was an executable communication happens over stdin/stdout. If the
command was a "host:port" part communication happens over a TCP channel. When
using TCP the server should already be running before starting vim.

COMMANDS                                        *lsc-commands*

                                                *:LSClientGoToDefinition*
Jump to the location defining the element under the cursor. Sends a
"textDocument/definition" request with the location set to the cursor's
position. If the cursor is not in the same position when the server responds
the jump will be canceled. With |lsc-default-map| this command is bound to
`<c-]>`.

If this version of vim supports |settagstack| the tag stack will also be
updated to include this jump. Jump back with `<c-t>` or |:pop|, it is not
possible to jump forward in the taglist when navigating with this client. The
jump will always be present in the |jumplist|, jump back with `<c-o>` or
forward with `<c-i>`.

                                                *:LSClientGoToDefinitionSplit*
Like |LSClientGoToDefinition|, except go to the location in a split,
respecting the 'switchbuf' option. With |lsc-default-map| this command is
bound to `<c-w>]` and `<c-w><c-]>`.

You can use this command with |mods|, for example, >

    :vertical LSClientGoToDefinitionSplit
<
will default to opening a vertical split, while >

    :tab LSClientGoToDefinitionSplit
<
will prefer a new tab.

                                                *:LSClientFindReferences*
Populate the |quickfix| with a list of location which reference the element
under the cursor, including it's definition. Sends a "textDocument/references"
request with the location set to the cursor's position. With
|lsc-default-map| this command is bound to "gr".

                                                *:LSClientNextReference*
                                                *:LSClientPreviousReference*
If there are reference highlights for the current buffer and the cursor is on
an element with references, jump to the next/previous reference to that
element. With |lsc-default-map| these are bound to "<c-n>" and "<c-p>"
respectively.

                                                *:LSClientFindImplementations*
Populate the |quickfix| with a list of location where there are
implementations of the element under the cursor, including it's definition.
Sends a "textDocument/implementation" request with the location set to the
cursor's position. With |lsc-default-map| this command is bound to "gI".

                                                *:LSClientDocumentSymbol*
Populate the |quickfix| with a list of the symbols defined in the current
buffer. Sends a "textDocument/documentSymbol" request. With |lsc-default-map|
this command is bound to "go".

                                                *:LSClientWorkspaceSymbol*
Populate the |quickfix| with a list of the symbols matching a search string.
Sends a "workspace/symbol" request. With no arguments this will prompt for a
search string, with one string argument it will search matching the argument.
With |lsc-default-map| this command is bound to "gS".

                                                *:LSClientShowHover*
Open a |preview| window with hover information corresponding to the element
under the cursor. Sends a "textDocument/hover" request with the location set
to the cursor's position. If there is no hover information will show a message
without opening the preview window. With |lsc-default-map| the |keywordprg| is
set to invoke this command.

If the preview window is already visible it will reuse it and maintain layout,
resizing it only if it is smaller than both |previewheight| and the size of
The new hover information.

If the preview window is not visible it will |split| the window and size it no
bigger than |previewheight|. Override the direction of the split by setting
|g:lsc_preview_split_direction| to either |above| or |below|.

See the help for the |preview-window| for more information. It can be quickly
closed with `<c-w><c-z>` without switching to that buffer.

                                                *:LSClientFindCodeActions*
Check for available actions at the cursor's position and display them in a
menu. Sends a "textDocument/codeAction" request to get the available choices,
and if one is selected sends a "workspace/executeCommand". With
|lsc-default-map| this command is bound to "ga". If no arguments are given a
menu is displayed with matching actions. If an argument is given it must be a
pattern, each action's `title` will be compared against this pattern. If
exactly one action matches the pattern it will be run automatically, if
multiple actions match the matching actions will be shown in a menu. The
comparison is done with |=~| which honors the users |ignorecase| and |magic|
settings, so it is recommended that the pattern start with one of the |\v| and
|\c| choices to make it resiliant against these settings.

                                                *:LSClientRename*
Request to rename the symbol under the cursor. Sends a "textDocument/rename"
request. If an argument is given it must be a String and will be used as the
replacement name. If no argument is given a prompt will ask for the new name.
With |lsc-default-map| this command is bount to "gR". This comand will not
exist if |g:lsc_enable_apply_edit| is set to `v:false`.

                                                *:LSClientAllDiagnostics*
Popupate the quickfix list with all diagnostics that have been sent by the
server, spanning all files. Depending on the server implementation this may
show all diagnostics for open files, or also diagnostics for files that have
not yet been opened. After running this command the quickfix list will be
updated any time diagnostics change, until the quickfix list is set by some
other command.

                                                *:LSClientLineDiagnostics*
Echo the full text of all diagnostics on the current line. Useful when a
diagnostic has been truncated or there are multiple diagnostics on a line and
otherwise only the diagnostic closest to the cursor is shown.

                                                *:LSClientRestartServer*
Sends requests to the server for the current filetype to "shutdown" and
"exit", and after the process exits, restarts it. If the server is
unresponsive to these requests it will need to be killed manually.

                                                *:LSClientDisable*
Sends requests to the server for the current filetype to "shutdown" and
"exit", and ignores further changes in these files.

                                                *:LSClientEnable*
If the server was previously disabled, restart the server and re-enable change
tracking for the current filetype.

FUNCTIONS                                       *lsc-functions*

                                                *LSCServerStatus()*
Returns a string representing the status of the language server for the
current filetype. If there is no configured command for this filetype returns
an empty string. The possible statuses are:

- "starting": The command has been started but the initialize call has not
  completed.
- "running": The command has been started and initialized and is running
  normally.
- "exiting": Exit was requested but the process has not yet finished.
- "restoring": Exit was requested and the server will be started again after
  the process finishes.
- "exited": Process has finished after a requested exit.
- "unexpected exit": Process has finished but no exit was requested.
- "failed": Process finished before initialization was complete. This could
  indicate that the command cannot be run at all.

CONFIGURATION                                   *lsc-configure*

                                                *lsc-configure-trace*
                                                *g:lsc_trace_level*
Set the "trace" field sent to the server during initialization using the
"g:lsc_trace_level". Valid values are "off", "messages", or "verbose".
Defaults to "off". Generally this field configures logging in the server.

                                                *lsc-configure-complete*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_autocomplete*
To disable the built-in autocompletion set "g:lsc_enable_autocomplete" to
"v:false". Requests for completions will only be sent if completion is
triggered manually with the completion function. Set |completefunc| or
|omnifunc| to "lsc#complete#complete" or have it set automatically for mapped
file types with |g:lsc_auto_map|. With manual completion the editor may
"hang" for up to 5 seconds while it waits for completion results to become
available.

Note: By default |completeopt| includes "preview" which will open the preview
window to show more details for selected completion items. Close the window
after completion with CTRL_W-z or disable with "set completeopt-=preview". To
automatically close the preview window after completion use the following:
>
 autocmd CompleteDone * silent! pclose
<

                                                *lsc-configure-completeopt*
                                                *g:lsc_auto_completeopt*
When using autocomplete this plugin will modify the buffer local setting
|completeopt| which may interfere with other plugins. These modifications are
recommended for a typical autocomplete experience and help to avoid the plugin
from making changes without a specific user action. Leave
`g:lsc_auto_completeopt` set to `v:true` (the default) for the recommended
values.

It is recommended to avoid other plugins which are attempting to perform
autocomplete in the same buffer as `vim-lsc`, but if they are used there may
be cases where they modify completeopt repeatedly and cause the options to get
repeated values added to it. In this case you may either:

1.  Set `g:lsc_auto_completeopt` to a String representing the options you'd
    like them set to on each completion occurrence (rather than appending).
    This may interfere with other plugins if they require different options,
    which aren't repeatedly set. For example:
>
 let g:lsc_auto_completeopt='menu,menuone,noinsert,noselect'
>
2.  Set `g:lsc_auto_completeopt` to `v:false` to indicate the `vim-lsc` should
    never attempt to change it. It is assumed that it will be set manually by
    the user to a compatible value and that it won't be changed by other
    plugins.

                                                *lsc-configure-complete-length*
                                                *g:lsc_autocomplete_length*
By default autocomplete attempts are started after typing any character the
server indicates is a "trigger" character, or after 3 word characters in a
row. Set `g:lsc_autocomplete_length` to start autocompelte attempts after a
different number of word characters. Set to `0` or `v:false` to disable
autocomplete following word characters and to use exclusively trigger
characters instead.

                                                *lsc-configure-complete-timeout*
                                                *g:lsc_complete_timeout*
When used as a manually invoked `completefunc` the results are expected
synchronously and the editor will be unresponsive. By default the client will
wait up to 5 seconds for results. The timeout can be adjusted by setting a
global variable `g;lsc_complete_timeout` to the number of seconds to wait. For
example:
>
 let g:lsc_complete_timeout = 0.5 " Wait up to a half second
<

                                                *lsc-configure-diagnostics*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_diagnostics*
Diagnostics highlighting and location list updating is enabled by default. To
disable diagnostic tracking set `g:lsc_enable_diagnostics` to `v:false`. With
diagnostics disabled |:LSClientAllDiagnostics| will never surface any results.
The server may communicate diagnostics but they will be ignored. Changing this
configuration while a server is running may have unexpected results, if it is
changed use |:LSClientRestartServer|.

                                                *lsc-configure-hover*
                                                *g:lsc_preview_split_direction*
By default the `:LSClientShowHover` command splits the window following
the setting |splitbelow|. Override the direction that the hover preview splits
with "g:lsc_preview_split_direction" set to either |above| or |below|. This
configuration will not impact the preview window which may open during
completion.

                                                *g:lsc_hover_popup*
When the |popup| feature is available it will be used for `:LSClientShowHover`
by default. Restore the old behavior of using the |preview-window| by setting
`g:lsc_hover_popup` to `v:false`.

                                                *lsc-configure-highlight*
vim-lsc uses highlight groups "lscDiagnosticError", "lscDiagnosticWarning",
"lscDiagnosticInfo", "lscDiagnosticHint", "lscReference", and
"lscCurrentParameter". By default "Error" is linked to |hl-Error|, "Warning" is
linked to |hl-SpllBad|, and "Info" and "Hint" are linked to |hl-SpellCap|.
"Reference" and "CurrentParameter" are linked to |hl-CursorColumn|. Override
this by setting or linking any of these highlight groups. For example:
>
 highlight lscDiagnosticError ctermbg=160
 highlight link lscDiagnosticWarning SpellCap
<

                                                *lsc-configure-key-map*
                                                *g:lsc_auto_map*
If you want to overload keymaps to operate specifically when vim-lsc is
enabled for a buffer set the variable "g:lsc_auto_map". Set the value to
"v:true" to use the defaults |lsc-default-map|, or set to a dict to use
other keys, or to only map a subset of the commands. Most keys correspond to
command names, for instance the key "GoToDefinition" creates a mapping for the
command "LSClientGoToDefinition".

The key "Completion" can choose a completefunc to set to the vim-lsc
completion function. By default this is |completefunc| but it can also be set
to |omnifunc| or have no completeion function set with an empty value.

The key "ShowHover" may have a string with a keymap like most other commands,
or it may be set to `v:true` to set `keywordprg` instead. The default is to
set `keywordprg`.

To override or unset only a subest of the defaults set the key "defaults" to
`v:true`. Any keys which have an empty value will not have keys mapped. For
instance to omit any mapping for |:LSClientFindImplementations| but use the
other defaults set this to:
>
 let g:lsc_auto_map = {'defaults': v:true, 'FindImplementations': ''}
<

                                                *lsc-default-map*
The default mapping for keys, if you've opted in to "g:lsc_auto_map" are:

<C-]>                   |:LSClientGoToDefinition|
<C-W>], <C-W><C-]>      |:LSClientGoToDefinitionSplit|
gr                      |:LSClientFindReferences|
<C-n>                   |:LSClientNextReference|
<C-p>                   |:LSClientPreviousReference|
gI                      |:LSClientFindImplementations|
go                      |:LSClientDocumentSymbol|
gS                      |:LSClientWorkspaceSymbol|
ga                      |:LSClientFindCodeActions|
gR                      |:LSClientRename|
gm                      |:LSClientSignatureHelp|
|K| (via |keywordprg|)      |:LSClientShowHover|


By default the |completefunc| is set to the vim-lsc manual completion
function.

                                                *lsc-configure-sync*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_incremental_sync*
By default the client will sync documents by sending the incremental diffs to
the servers which indicate support for this method. Disable incremental sync
for all servers by setting `g:lsc_enable_incremental_sync` to `v:false`.

Using incremental sync causes the client to store an extra copy of each synced
buffer in memory to allow diffing against previous versions.

The diff algorithm will match the longest possible prefix and suffix against
the old content and send a single change for the content in between. Certain
edits which simultaneously change content near the beginning and end of the
buffer can cause large changes to be sent, but in most cases the messages will
be smaller than with full syncs.

                                                *lsc-configure-edits*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_apply_edit*
By default the client will modify buffers in response to `workspace/applyEdit`
messages. To disable edits set `g:lsc_enable_apply_edit` to `v:false`.

                                                *lsc-snippet-support*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_snippet_support*
By default the client disables support for snippets as insert text. If set to
`v:true` and supported by the server, insert text may contain snippets.

Autocompletion of snippets requires a plugin that can complete using
`user_data` on `CompleteDone`, such as neosnippet.vim

                                                *lsc-configure-references*
                                                *g:lsc_reference_highlights*
By default the client will highlight references to the element under the
cursor whenver the server has support. Disable these highlights by setting
`g:lsc_reference_highlights` to `v:false`. Configure highlighting with the
`lscReference` highlight group. See |lsc-configure-highlight|.

AUTOCMDS                                        *lsc-autocmds*

                                                *autocmd-LSCAutocomplete*
Fires before triggering completion in auto-complete mode. Does not fire if
|g:lsc_enable_autocomplete| is false. For example, if windows normally split
above (set |nosplitbelow|) but the completion-menu preview window should split
below:
>
 augroup completsplitbelow
   autocmd User LSCAutocomplete setlocal splitbelow
   autocmd CompleteDone * setlocal nosplitbelow
 augroup END
<
                                                *autocmd-LSCShowPreview*
Fires when LSC opens a new preview window during `:LSClientShowHover` or
`LSClientSignatureHelp`. Does not fire if an exist preview window was reused.
For example if the hover information should display full-height, 80 columns
wide, at the left of the screen instead of as a horizontal split:
>
 autocmd User LSCShowPreview wincmd H | vertical resize 80
<
                                                *autocmd-LSCOnChangesFlushed*
Fires after LSC sends a `textDocument/didOpen` or `textDocument/didChange`
request.

SERVER CUSTOMIZATION                            *lsc-server-customization*

When the server configuration is a `dict` (see |lsc-setup|) the following
advanced behavior can be configured.

                                                *lsc-server-command*
`'command'`: (Required). The command to run or a "host:port" pair. See
|lsc-setup|.

                                                *lsc-server-name*
`'name'`: A friendly name for the server. Only the first configuration with a
given name is used. Defaults to the same value as `'command'`. Filetypes which
are configured with the same name use the same server.

                                                *lsc-server-enabled*
`'enabled'`: Set to `v:false` to avoid starting the server until
|:LSClientEnable| is called.

                                                *lsc-server-log_level*
`'log_level'`: May be one of `'Error'`, `'Warning'`, `'Info'`, or `'Log'`.
Default `'Info'`. Messages through `window/logMessage` will only be echoed
if they are at this level or above. With the default value of `'Info'`
only `'Log'` messages are suppressed. Set to `-1` to disable echo for any
message.

                                                *lsc-server-suppress_stderr*
`'suppress_stderr'`: Set to `v:true` to suppress stderr output which is
received after the server has been initialized. Stderr output before
initialization still is shown in an error message. Use this if the server uses
stderr for noisy status or logging.

                                                *lsc-server-message_hooks*
`'message_hooks'`: Set to a dictionary where the keys are LSP method names and
the values are either |funcref|s which may modify '`params`' for the call, or
dicts of values to merge in to the '`params`'. If the value is a dict then
each value within the dict should be either a value that can be translated
into json (including nested dicts) or a |funcref| which will return a value
for that key. Functions must take two arguments, the method name being called
(for example `'textDocument/didOpen'`) and the parameters dict. For requests
which take no parameters the second value may be `v:null`. The modified or new
params should be returned by the function.

If the returned value is specifically the return from `lsc#config#skip()` then
the call will not be made.

For example:
>
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
     \ 'c': {
     \    'command': 'clangd',
     \    'message_hooks': {
     \        'initialize': {
     \            'initializationOptions': {'foo': 'bar'},
     \            'rootUri': {method, params ->
     \                          lsc#uri#documentUri(FindProjectRoot())},
     \        },
     \        'textDocument/didOpen': {'metadata': {'extraFlags': ['-Wall']}},
     \    },
     \  },
     \}
<
                                                *lsc-server-notifications*
`notifications`: Set to a dictionary where the keys are LSP notification
methods and the values are |funcref|s to be invoked when those notifications
arrive. The callback should take two arguments, the first is the `method` for
the notification, the second is the `params`. The method will start with `$`.
This can be used to hook in to server specific functionality that isn't part
of the LSP spec.

For example:
>
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
     \ 'dart': {
     \    'command': 'dart_language_server',
     \    'notifications': {
     \        '$/analyzerStatus': function('<SID>HandleStatus'),
     \    },
     \  },
     \}

 function! s:HandleStatus(method, params) abort
   " Used in statusline to show when server is busy
   let g:dart_server_status = a:params.isAnalyzing
 endfunction

<

                                                *lsc-server-workspace_config*
`workspace_config`: Set to any json encodable value which will be sent to the
server after startup as the `settings` in a `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`
notificaiton. See the documentation for your server for what values are accepted
in this notification.

For example:
>
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
     \ 'rust': {
     \    'command': 'rls',
     \    'workspace_config': {
     \        'clippy_preference': 'on',
     \    },
     \  },
     \}

DEBUGGING TIPS                                  *lsc-debugging*

If you are having difficulty with integration with a particular language
server, you can spy into the communication with the server by wrapping it in a
script to log stdin and stdout. For example if the server is normally started
with "my_language_server", write a script like "my_language_server_logged.sh"
and point |g:lsc_server_commands| at this script.
>
 #!/bin/bash
 tee in.log | my_language_server | tee out.log
<
If a language server is following the protocol but does not work with vim-lsc,
file an issue at https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc/issues
