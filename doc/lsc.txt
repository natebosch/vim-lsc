*lsc*  Language Server Client

INTRODUCTION                                    *lsc-intro*

vim-lsc communicates with a server following the Language Server Protocol and
adds autocomplete, diagnostic highlighting, and reference searching.

vim-lsc does not have any built-in support for any language, all features are
enabled through language specific servers and should work with any server
following the protocol. Each feature is dependent on support in the configured
server.

https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc

SETUP                                           *lsc-setup*
                                                *g:lsc_server_commands*

There is no install step for vim-lsc. Configure the filetypes that are tracked
by installed language servers in the variable "g:lsc_server_commands". Each
value in this dict should be a string which corresponds to either an
executable in your "$PATH", and absolute path to an executable, or a
"host:port" pair. If multiple filetypes are tracked by the same server they
should be entered as separate keys with the same value. The value may also be
a `dict` to allow for additional configuration. Set |lsc-server-customization|
for allowed keys. `'command'` is required and matches the command above when a
dict is not used.

For example:

>
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
     \ 'dart': 'dart_language_server',
     \ 'html': 'dart_language_server',
     \ 'typescript': 'localhost:8000',
     \ 'lua': {
     \   'name': 'lua',
     \   'command': 'lua-ls',
     \   'enabled': v:false,
     \ },
     \}
<

lsc will communicate with each server following the LSP protocol. If the
command was an executable communication happens over stdin/stdout. If the
command was a "host:port" part communication happens over a TCP channel. When
using TCP the server should already be running before starting vim.

COMMANDS                                        *lsc-commands*

                                                *:LSClientGoToDefinition*
Jump to the location defining the element under the cursor. Sends a
"textDocument/definition" request with the location set to the cursor's
position. If the cursor is not in the same position when the server responds
the jump will be canceled. With |lsc-default-map| this command is bound to
<c-]>

                                                *:LSClientFindReferences*
Populate the |quickfix| with a list of location which reference the element
under the cursor, including it's definition. Sends a "textDocument/references"
request with the location set to the cursor's position. With
|lsc-default-map| this command is bound to "gr".

                                                *:LSClientDocumentSymbol*
Populate the |quickfix| with a list of the symbols defined in the current
buffer. Sends a "textDocument/documentSymbol" request. With |lsc-default-map|
this command is bound to "go".

                                                *:LSClientShowHover*
Open a |preview| window with hover information corresponding to the element
under the cursor. Sends a "textDocument/hover" request with the location set
to the cursor's position. If there is no hover information will show a message
without opening the preview window. With |lsc-default-map| this command is
bound to "K".

If the preview window is already visible it will reuse it and maintain layout,
resizing it only if it is smaller than both |previewheight| and the size of
The new hover information.

If the preview window is not visible it will |split| the window and size it no
bigger than |previewheight|. Override the direction of the split by setting
|g:lsc_preview_split_direction| to either |above| or |below|.

                                                *:LSClientFindCodeActions*
Check for available actions at the cursor's position and display them in a
menu. Sends a "textDocument/codeAction" request to get the available choices,
and if one is selected sends a "workspace/executeCommand". Typically actions
end up triggering workspace edits so this command is likely only useful if
|g:lsc_enable_apply_edit| is set to `v:true`. With |lsc-default-map| this
command is bound to "ga".

                                                *:LSClientRename*
Request to rename the symbol under the cursor. Sends a "textDocument/rename"
request. If an argument is given it must be a String and will be used as the
replacement name. If no argument is given a prompt will ask for the new name.
This command only exists if |g:lscEnable_apply_edit| is `v:true`. With
|lsc-default-map| this command is bount to "gR".

                                                *:LSClientAllDiagnostics*
Popupate the quickfix list with all diagnostics that have been sent by the
server, spanning all files. Depending on the server implementation this may
show all diagnostics for open files, or also diagnostics for files that have
not yet been opened.

                                                *:LSClientRestartServer*
Sends requests to the server for the current filetype to "shutdown" and
"exit", and after the process exits, restarts it. If the server is
unresponsive to these requests it will need to be killed manually.

                                                *:LSClientDisable*
Sends requests to the server for the current filetype to "shutdown" and
"exit", and ignores further changes in these files.

                                                *:LSClientEnable*
If the server was previously disabled, restart the server and re-enable change
tracking for the current filetype.

FUNCTIONS                                       *lsc-functions*

                                                *LSCServerStatus()*
Returns a string representing the status of the language server for the
current filetype. If there is no configured command for this filetype returns
an empty string. The possible statuses are:

- "starting": The command has been started but the initialize call has not
  completed.
- "running": The command has been started and initialized and is running
  normally.
- "exiting": Exit was requested but the process has not yet finished.
- "restoring": Exit was requested and the server will be started again after
  the process finishes.
- "exited": Process has finished after a requested exit.
- "unexpected exit": Process has finished but no exit was requested.
- "failed": Process finished before initialization was complete. This could
  indicate that the command cannot be run at all.

CONFIGURATION                                   *lsc-configure*

                                                *lsc-configure-trace*
                                                *g:lsc_trace_level*
Set the "trace" field sent to the server during initialization using the
"g:lsc_trace_level". Valid values are "off", "messages", or "verbose".
Defaults to "off". Generally this field configures logging in the server.

                                                *lsc-configure-complete*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_autocomplete*
To disable the built-in autocompletion set "g:lsc_enable_autocomplete" to
"v:false". Requests for completions will still be sent to the server, but the
response will not open the popupmenu or complete words. Set |completefunc| or
|omnifunc| to "lsc#complete#complete" to manually trigger completion on demand.
The function will have no completions if it is not made in a position where
autocomplete would have shown suggestions, or if the server has not responded
with results before completion is started.

The completefunc can be automatically set for buffers with files tracked by a
language server by setting the "Complete" key in |g:lsc_auto_map|.

Note: By default |completeopt| includes "preview" which will open the preview
window to show more details for selected completion items. Close the window
after completion with CTRL_W-z or disable with "set completeopt-=preview". To
automatically close the preview window after completion use the following:
>
 autocmd CompleteDone * silent! pclose
<

                                                *lsc-configure-hover*
                                                *g:lsc_preview_split_direction*
By default the `:LSClientShowHover` command splits the window following
the setting |splitbelow|. Override the direction that the hover preview splits
with "g:lsc_preview_split_direction" set to either |above| or |below|. This
configuration will not impact the preview window which may open during
completion.

                                                *lsc-configure-highlight*
vim-lsc uses highlight groups "lscDiagnosticError", "lscDiagnosticWarning",
"lscDiagnosticInfo", and "lscDiagnosticHint". By default "Error" is linked to
|hl-Error|, "Warning" is linked to |hl-SpllBad|, and "Info" and "Hint" are
linked to |hl-SpellCap|. Override this by setting or linking any of these
highlight groups. For example:
>
 highlight lscDiagnosticError ctermbg=160
 highlight link lscDiagnosticWarning SpellCap
<

                                                *lsc-configure-key-map*
                                                *g:lsc_auto_map*
If you want to overload keymaps to operate specifically when vim-lsc is
enabled for a buffer set the variable "g:lsc_auto_map". Set the value to
"v:true" to use the defaults |lsc-default-map|, or set to a dict to use
other keys, or to only map a subset of the commands. The available keys
correspond to command names - "GoToDefinition", "FindReferences", and
"ShowHover". Additionally the key "Completion" can choose a completefunc to
set to the vim-lsc completion function, this will only have effect if
|g:lsc_enable_autocomplete| is "v:false".

                                                *lsc-default-map*
The default mapping for keys, if you've opted in to "g:lsc_auto_map" are:

<C-]>                   |:LSClientGoToDefinition|
gr                      |:LSClientFindReferences|
go                      |:LSClientDocumentSymbol|
ga                      |:LSClientFindCodeActions|
gR                      |:LSClientRename|
K                       |:LSClientShowHover|

If "g:lsc_enable_autocomplete" is set to "v:false" then |completefunc| will be
set to the vim-lsc completion function.

                                                *lsc-configure-sync*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_incremental_sync*
By default the client will only attempt to sync documents by sending the full
text on every change. If the server indicates support for incremental document
syncing in the `ServerCapabilities` response during initialization, and the
`g:lsc_enable_incremental_sync` variable is set to `v:true`, the client will
send incremental diffs instead. This feature is experimental and when it
becomes stable the default value for this option will change to `v:true`.

This option causes the client to store an extra copy of each synced buffer in
memory to allow diffing against previous versions.

The diff algorithm will match the longest possible prefix and suffix against
the old content and send a single change for the content in between. Certain
edits which simultaneously change content near the beginning and end of the
buffer can cause large changes to be sent, but in most cases the messages will
be smaller than with full syncs.

                                                *lsc-configure-edits*
                                                *g:lsc_enable_apply_edit*
By default the client will not modify any buffer in response to
`workspace/applyEdit` calls. To enable edits set to `v:true`.

AUTOCMDS                                        *lsc-autocmds*

                                                *autocmd-LSCAutocomplete*
Fires before triggering completion in auto-complete mode. Does not fire if
|g:lsc_enable_autocomplete| is false. For example, if windows normally split
above (set |nosplitbelow|) but the completion-menu preview window should split
below:
>
 augroup completsplitbelow
   autocmd User LSCAutocomplete setlocal splitbelow
   autocmd CompleteDone * setlocal nosplitbelow
 augroup END
<
                                                *autocmd-LSCShowPreview*
Fires when LSC opens a new preview window during `:LSClientShowHover`. Does
not fire if an exist preview window was reused. For example if the hover
information should display full-height, 80 columns wide, at the left of the
screen instead of as a horizontal split:
>
 autocmd User LSCShowPreview wincmd H | vertical resize 80
<
SERVER CUSTOMIZATION                            *lsc-server-cusomization*

When the server configuration is a `dict` (see |lsc-setup|) the following
advanced behavior can be configured.

                                                *lsc-server-command*
`'command'`: (Required). The command to run or a "host:port" pair. See
|lsc-setup|.

                                                *lsc-server-name*
`'name'`: A friendly name for the server. Only the first configuration with a
given name is used. Defaults to the same value as `'command'`. Filetypes which
are configured with the same name use the same server.

                                                *lsc-server-enabled*
`'enabled'`: Set to `v:false` so aoid starting the server until
|:LSClientEnable| is called.

                                                *lsc-server-message_hooks*
`'message_hooks'`: Set to a dictionary where the keys are LSP method names and
the values are either |funcref|s which may modify '`params`' for the call, or
dicts of values to merge in to the '`params`'. If the value is a dict then
each value within the dict should be either a value that can be translated
into json (including nested dicts) or a |funcref| which will return a value
for that key. Functions must take two arguments, the method name being called
(for example `'textDocument/didOpen'`) and the parameters dict. For requests
which take no parameters the second value may be `v:null`. The modified or new
params should be returned by the function.

For example:
>
 let g:lsc_server_commands = {
     \ 'c': {
     \    'command': 'clangd',
     \    'message_hooks': {
     \        'initialize': {
     \            'initializationOptions': {'foo': 'bar'},
     \            'rootUri': {method, params ->
     \                          lsc#uri#documentUri(FindProjectRoot())},
     \        }
     \        'textDocument/didOpen': {'metadata': {'extraFlags': ['-Wall']}},
     \    },
     \  },
     \}

DEBUGGING TIPS                                  *lsc-debugging*

If you are having difficulty with integration with a particular language
server, you can spy into the communication with the server by wrapping it in a
script to log stdin and stdout. For example if the server is normally started
with "my_language_server", write a script like "my_language_server_logged.sh"
and point |g:lsc_server_commands| at this script.
>
 #!/bin/bash
 tee in.log | my_language_server | tee out.log
